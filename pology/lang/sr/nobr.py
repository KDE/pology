"""
Equip text with no-break characters where possibly helpful.

The way text is wrapped in UI, by a general wrapping algorithm,
is sometimes really not appropriate for Serbian ortography.
For example, hyphen-separated case ending should not be wrapped.
This module contains functions to heuristically replace ordinary
with no-break characters, where such bad breaks can be expected.

    Replace some ordinary hyphens with no-break hyphens [hook factory].

    An ordinary hyphen is replaced in one of the following modes,
    as given by the C{mode} parameter:
      - 0: if the hyphen is in between two letters, and either preceded
            or followed by at most four letters
      - 1: if the hyphen is in between two letters and followed by
            exactly one letter

    Using the C{wchars} parameter, some extra characters other than letters
    can be treated as equal to letters.

    Note that the function by default substitutes the hyphen only if
    there are some Cyrillic letters (or an extra character) in the context,
    as otherwise the hyphen may be a part of URL, command, etc.
    This can be relaxed by setting C{unsafe} to C{True},
    when all letters are treated equally.
