README of pology rules, dictionary and hooks of the KDE l10n Spanish team.

In this moment there is not any web page about pology in Spanish.
A good reference about the use of pology by translators is the page of 
the French translation team at: http://fr.i18n.kde.org/pology.php

It is based in the file with the same name of the French team, but has been 
widely simplified and modified.

2.-Dictionary.
--------------
  Contains a list of words used as complementary dictionary for aspell.
The words are: names of persons related with KDE, acronyms, trade marks, 
programs, abbreviations, names of countries and capitals, chemical elements 
and compounds, units, etc..
  The name of the file is "dict.aspell" in the spell subdirectory.
The file "ignoredContext" in the same subdirectory, contains a list 
of context that should no be checked in any case.
  The dictionary is not of exclusive use of pology. It can be used by 
any other application that use aspell as spell checker. This is the case 
of all KDE applications and definitely Lokalize. To allow this use, add a 
symbolic link from the dictionary to "~/.aspell-$LANGUAGE.pws". See aspell 
documentation for details.
  In order to help the maintenance of the dictionary, there are some list of words 
sorted by topic, at the subdirectory "spell-spec". The whole dictionary can be generated 
using the script "update-dict.sh". The reason of that structure is that 
having a single dictionary allow it use outside pology.
