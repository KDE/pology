Rule files syntax
=================

Naming and path: 
- a rule file must end with a ".rules" suffix.
- rule files must be located into the l10n/<lang>/rules directory, where <lang> corresponds to your language code (eg. 'fr' for french rules).

File structure and syntax: 
- All lines begining with a # are considered as comments.
- Each rule file must begin with a header indicating the author(s) and license.
- Each rule file must end with a footer composed of a line of comment (eg. # End of rule file).
- A blank line is used to separate two rules.

Rule definition: 
- A rule is composed of three parts: 
	o The pattern. It is used to find text matching the rule. The pattern should be a valid regular expression.
	o The hint. It indicates the user what to do to correct the message.
	o Valid expression. It indicates exceptions for which the rule should not match.
- Pattern and hint are mandatory. Valid expression is optional.

Pattern syntax: 
- [regexp] # where 'regexp' is a regular expression ; eg. [status|statut] will trigger the rule for the words 'status' and 'statut'.

Hint syntax: 
- hint="hint message" # eg. hint="remplacer `status' ou `statut' par `état'".

Valid expression syntax: 
One rule can have multiple valid expressions. Each is evaluated separately and may be made of regular expressions (represented below with the word 'regexp'). Here are some examples:
- valid after="regexp" # the rule will not match if it is found after the provided pattern/word
- valid before="regexp" # the rule will not match if it is found before the provided pattern/word
- valid before="regexp" after="regexp" # both are needed to cancel the rule triggering
- valid file="myApps.po" # always valid for this .po file
- valid file="myApps.po" after="regexp" before="regexp"
- valid ctx="regexp" after="regexp" before="regexp" # only in a message in this PO context
- valid file="myApps.po" msgid="The msgid to consider" # only in this message in this .po file (but do we really need this kind of rules ?)

Eg. of rule: 
[status|statut]
valid after="[Ss]mb"   
hint="remplacer `status' ou `statut' par `état'"
