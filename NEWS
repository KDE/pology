Release 0.13:

Release 0.12:

  New functionality:

  * check-rules sieve: New parameter 'byrule' to list failed messages
    at the end of processing sorted by rule identifier.

  * new unfuzzy-qtclass-only sieve: Unfuzzy messages which were
    fuzzied due to C++ class name change in code, in catalogs
    derived by conversion from Qt Linguist translation files.

  * posummit: New field to set the precedence of summit subdirectories
    (S.subdir_precedence), so that branch catalogs existing in
    two or more branch subdirectories are always located in
    the higher priority summit subdirectory.
    When processing summit catalogs with some precedence set,
    the order of processing is also following the precedence,
    instead of being alphabetical by path throughout.

  * Syntax highlighting for code snippets in the user manual.

  * Updated language support (spelling, rules, etc):
    Catalan, French, Galician, Norwegian, Serbian, Spanish.

  * Updated project-specific support: KDE.

  Modified functionality:

  * stats sieve: File with list of incomplete catalogs
    (when setting 'incompfile' parameter ) is always written,
    even if all catalogs are complete, i.e. empty list file is produced.
    This prevents an old list file appearing as the new one.

  * posummit: When branch catalogs without expected corresponding
    summit catalogs are detected (on merge and scatter), instead of
    error a warning is issued. It has been seen in practice that
    higher attention demanded by error was more trouble than worth.
    Such branch catalogs are then skipped during the operation.

  Fixed bugs:

  * Word wrapping of message fields when writing catalogs was wrong
    in some cases when visual and character word lengths were different
    (e.g. CJK languages). This could have resulted in corrupted catalogs.

  * stats sieve: Heuristics for splitting word count from fuzzy messages
    into translated/untranslated (when 'ondiff' parameter is issued)
    will no longer cause negative additions.

  * More detailed licensing information throughout.

  * Adapted VCS handling for Subversion 1.7.

Release 0.11:

  New functionality:

  * Word capitalization in internal word lists for spell checking is now
    treated the same for Hunspell as for Aspell (upcased word in text
    compared to word in word list allowed, downcased not allowed).

  * check-spell-* sieve: parameter 'case' to make matching patterns
    case-sensitive.

  * Updated language support (spelling, rules, etc):
    Catalan, French, Galician, Serbian, Spanish.

  Modified functionality:

  * Bumped CMake requirement to 2.8.3.

  Fixed bugs:

  * Highlighting spans of negative length in message reporting no longer
    cause the message to be dropped.

  * File paths are now thoroughly decoded and encoded as required,
    so that non-ASCII paths will work properly in all contexts.

Release 0.10.1:

  Fixed bugs:

  * Reporting error messages itself was prone to crashing at various
    places, depending on message content and locale.

  * pomtrans: Some problems with invoking Apertium (hardcoded binary path,
    too late language pair validation, etc).

  * When reporting PO messages to Lokalize, sometimes a non-responsive
    instance of Lokalize was used, resulting in no message being reported.

Release 0.10:

  * First formal release.
