Release 0.11:

  New functionality:

  * Word capitalization in internal word lists for spell checking is now
    treated the same for Hunspell as for Aspell (upcased word in text
    compared to word in word list allowed, downcased not allowed).

  * check-spell-* sieve: parameter 'case' to make matching patterns
    case-sensitive.

  * Updated language support (spelling, rules, etc):
    Catalan, French, Galician, Serbian, Spanish.

  Modified functionality:

  * Bumped CMake requirement to 2.8.3.

  Fixed bugs:

  * Highlighting spans of negative length in message reporting no longer
    cause the message to be dropped.

  * File paths are now thoroughly decoded and encoded as required,
    so that non-ASCII paths will work properly in all contexts.

Release 0.10.1:

  Fixed bugs:

  * Reporting error messages itself was prone to crashing at various
    places, depending on message content and locale.

  * pomtrans: Some problems with invoking Apertium (hardcoded binary path,
    too late language pair validation, etc).

  * When reporting PO messages to Lokalize, sometimes a non-responsive
    instance of Lokalize was used, resulting in no message being reported.

Release 0.10:

  * First formal release.
