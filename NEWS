Release 0.10.1:

  Fixed bugs:

  * Reporting error messages itself was prone to crashing at various
    places, depending on message content and locale.

  * pomtrans: Some problems with invoking Apertium (hardcoded binary path,
    too late language pair validation, etc).

  * When reporting PO messages to Lokalize, sometimes a non-responsive
    instance of Lokalize was used, resulting in no message being reported.

Release 0.10:

* First formal release.
