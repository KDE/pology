<title>Sieving</title>

<para>Translator may want to apply batch-type operations to every message in a single PO file or in collection of PO files, such as searching and replacing text, computing statistics, or validating. However, batch-processing tools for general plain text (<command>grep</command>, <command>sed</command>, <command>awk</command>, etc.) are not very well suited to processing PO files. For example, when looking for a particular word, a generic search tool will not see it if it contains an <link linkend="sec-poaccel">accelerator marker</link>; or, if looking for a two-word phrase, a generic tool will miss it if it is <link linkend="sec-powrap">wrapped</link>. Therefore many tools tailored specifically for batch-processing messages in PO files have been developed, such as those bundled with <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/">Gettext</ulink> (<command>msggrep</command>, <command>msgfilter</command>, <command>msgattrib</command>...), or from <ulink url="http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/toolkit/index">Translate Toolkit</ulink> (<command>pocount</command>, <command>pogrep</command>, <command>pofilter</command>...).</para>

<para>Pology also provides a per-message batch-processing tool, the <command>posieve</command>. What was the need for it, given the myriad of other previously available and powerful tools? In accordance with philosophy of Pology, <command>posieve</command> goes deeper than these other tools. <command>posieve</command> makes easy that which is possible but awkward by combining generic command line tools. <command>posieve</command> is modular from the ground up, such that it is never a design problem to add new functionality to it, even when it is of narrow applicability. Users who know some Python can even write own "plugins" for it. Several processing modules can be applied in a single run of <command>posieve</command>, possibly affecting each other, in ways not possible by generic shell piping and not requiring temporary intermediate files.</para>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<sect1 id="sec-svbasics">
<title>Basic Usage of <command>posieve</command></title>

<para>The <command>posieve</command> script itself is actually a simple shell for applying various processing modules, called <emphasis>sieves</emphasis>, to every message in one or more PO files. Some sieves can also request to operate on the header of the PO file, which <command>posieve</command> will then feed to them. A sieve can both examine and modify messages; if any message is modified, by default the modified PO file will be written out in place. Naturally, <command>posieve</command> has a number of options, but more interestingly, each sieve can define some parameters which determine its behavior. Pology comes with many internal sieves, which do things from general to obscure (possibly language or project specific), and users can define their own sieves.</para>

<para>Here is how you would run the <link linkend="sv-stats"><command>stats</command></link> sieve to collect statistics on all PO files in <filename>frobaz/</filename> directory:
<programlisting>
$ posieve stats frobaz/
</programlisting>
While PO files in <filename>frobaz/</filename> are being processed, you will see a progress bar with the current file and the number of files to process, and after some time the <command>stats</command> sive will present its findings in a table.</para>

<para>The first non-option argument in the <command>posieve</command> command line is the sieve name, and then any number of directory or file paths can be specified.
<command>posieve</command> will consider file path arguments to be PO files, and recursively search directory paths to collect all files ending with <filename>.po</filename> or <filename>.pot</filename>. If no paths are specified, PO files to process will be collected from the current working directory.</para>

<para>If the sieve modifies a message and the new PO file is written out in place of the old, the user will be informed by an exclamation mark followed by the file path. An example of a sieve which modifies messages is the <link linkend="sv-tag-untranslated"><command>tag-untranslated</command></link> sieve; it adds
the <literal>untranslated</literal> flag to every untranslated message, so that you can look them up in a plain text editor (as opposed to <link linkend="sec-poedlist">dedicated PO editor</link>):
<programlisting>
$ posieve tag-untranslated frobaz/
! frobaz/alfa.po
! frobaz/bravo.po
! frobaz/charlie.po
Tagged 42 untranslated messages.
</programlisting>
<command>posieve</command> itself tracks message modifications and informs about modified PO files, whereas the final line in this example has been output by the <command>tag-untranslated</command> sieve. Sieves will frequently issue such final reports of their actions.</para>

<para id="p-svparam">If a sieve defines some parameters to control its behavior, these can be issued using the <option>-s</option>. This option takes the parameter specification as the argument, which is of the form <literal><replaceable>name</replaceable>:<replaceable>value</replaceable></literal> or just <literal><replaceable>name</replaceable></literal> for switch-type parameters. More than one parameter can be issued by repeating the <option>-s</option>. For example, the <command>stats</command> sieve can be instructed to take into account only messages with at most 5 words:
<programlisting>
$ posieve stats -s maxwords:5 frobaz/
</programlisting>
to show statistics in greater detail:
<programlisting>
$ posieve stats -s detail frobaz/
</programlisting>
or to ignore a certain accelerator marker and show bar-type statistics instead of tabular:
<programlisting>
$ posieve stats -s accel:_ -s msgbar frobaz/
</programlisting>
</para>

<para><command>posieve</command> lists and shows descriptions of its options by the usual <option>-h</option>/<option>--help</option> option. Help for a sieve can be requested by issuing the <option>-H</option>/<option>--help-sieves</option> while a sieve name is present in the command line. All available internal sieves with short descriptions are listed using <option>-l</option>/<option>--list-sieves</option>.</para>

<para>Some sieves are language-specific, which can be seen by their names being of the form <command><replaceable>langcode</replaceable>:<replaceable>name</replaceable></command>. These sieves are primarily intendedfor use on PO files translated to indicated language, but depending on particularities, may be applicable to several more closely related languages. (A sieve which is doing language-specific things, but which is applicable to many languages, is more likely to be named as a general sieve.)</para>

<para>If <link linkend="sec-cmshellcomp">shell completion</link> is active, it can be used to complete sieve names and their parameters.</para>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<sect1 id="sec-svchains">
<title>Sieve Chains</title>

<para>It is possible to issue several sieves at once, by passing a comma-separated list of sieve names to <command>posieve</command> in place of single sieve name. This is called a <emphasis>sieve chain</emphasis>.</para>

<para>At minimum, chaining sieves is a performance improving measure, since each PO file is opened (and possibly written out) only once, instead of on each sieve run. For example, you can in one run compute the statistics to see how many messages need to be update and tag all untranslated messages:
<programlisting>
$ posieve stats,tag-untranslated frobaz/
! frobaz/alfa.po
! frobaz/bravo.po
! frobaz/charlie.po
... (table with statistics) ...
Tagged 42 untranslated messages.
</programlisting>
A message in the PO file is passed through each sieve in turn, in the order in which they are issued, before proceding to the next message. If a sieve modifies the message, the next sieve in the chain will operate on that modified version of the message. This means that the ordering of sieves in the command line is significant in general, and that it is interchangable only if the sieves in the chain are independent of each other (as in this example). Chain order also determines the order in which sieve reports are shown; if in this example the order had been <literal>tag-untranslated,stats</literal>, then first the tagged messages line would be written out, followed by the statistics table.</para>

<para>Other than for performance, sieve chains are useful when messages should be modified in a particular way before a sieve gets to operate on it. A good example is when statistics is to be computed on PO files which contain old <link linkend="p-embctxt">embedded contexts</link>, where if nothing would be done, contexts would add to the word count of the original text. To avoid this, a <link linkend="sv-normctxt-sep">context normalization</link> sieve (which converts embedded contexts to <varname>msgctxt</varname>) can be chained with statistics sieve, and the <command>posieve</command> instructed not to write modifications to the PO file. If the embedded context is of the single-separator type, with separator character <literal>|</literal>, the sieve chain is:
<programlisting>
$ posieve --no-sync normctxt-sep,stats -s sep:'|' frobaz/
Converted 21 separator-embedded contexts.
... (table with statistics) ...
</programlisting>
The <option>--no-sync</option> option prevents writing modified messages in the PO file on disk. Note that <literal>|</literal> as parameter value is quoted, because it would be interpreted as a shell pipe otherwise.</para>

<para>Finally, some sieves can stop messages from being pushed further through the sieve chain, so they can be used as a prefilter to other sieves. The     archetypal example of this the <link linkend="sv-find-messages"><command>find-messages</command></link>, which stops non-matched messages from further sieving. For example, to include into statistics only the messages containing the word "quasar", this would be executed:
<programlisting>
$ posieve find-messages,stats -s msgid:quasar -s nomsg
Found 12 messages satisfying the conditions.
... (table with statistics) ...
</programlisting>
The <option>msgid:</option> parameter specifies the word (actually, a regular expression) to be looked up in the original text, while <option>nomsg</option> parameter tells <command>find-messages</command> not to write out matched messages to standard output, which it would by default do. Note that no path was specified, meaning that all PO files in current working directory and below will be sieved.</para>

<para>Examples of sieve chaining so far should have raised the following question: when several sieves are issued, to which of them are the parameters specified by <option>-s</option> options passed? The answer is that a parameter is sent to all sieves which accept parameter of that name. Continuing the previous example, if message texts can contain accelerator marker <literal>&amp;</literal>, this would be specified like this:
<programlisting>
$ posieve find-messages,stats -s msgid:quasar -s nomsg -s accel:'&amp;'
</programlisting>
<command>find-messages</command> will accept <option>accel</option> in order to also match messages like <literal>"Charybdis Q&amp;uasar"</literal>, while <command>stats</command> will use it to properly split text into words for counting them.</para>

<listitem>
<para>For <command>posieve</command> to process the PO file, it is only necessary that basic PO syntax is valid, i.e. that <command>msgfmt</command> can compile the file. <command>msgfmt</command> also offers stricter validation mode: to have <command>posieve</command> run this stricter validation on the PO file, issue this option.

For configuration fields that have counterpart command line options, the command line option always takes precedence if issued.</para>

<para id="p-confsvpar">Configuration can also be used to issue sieve parameters, by specifying <literal>[posieve]/param-<replaceable>name</replaceable></literal> fields. For example, parameters <option>transl</option> (a switch) and <option>accel</option> (with value <literal>&amp;</literal>) are issued to all sieves that accept them by writing:
<programlisting>
[posieve]
param-transl = yes
param-accel = &amp;
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>To issue parameters only to certain sieves, parameter name can be followed
by a sieve list of the form <literal>/<replaceable>sieve1</replaceable>,<replaceable>sieve2</replaceable>,...</literal>; to <emphasis>prevent</emphasis> the parameter from being issued only to certain sieves, prepend <literal>~</literal> to the sieve list. For example:
<programlisting>
[posieve]
param-transl/find-messages = yes  # only for find-messages
param-accel/~stats = &amp;            # not for stats
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Same parameters can sometimes be repeated in the command line, when it is logically meaningfull to provide several values of that type to a sieve. However, same-name fields cannot be used in configuration to supply several values, because they override each other. Instead, a dot and a unique string (within the sequence) can be appended to the parameter name to make it a unique configuration field:
<programlisting>
[posieve]
param-accel.0 = &amp;
param-accel.1 = _
</programlisting>
Strings after the dot can be anything, but a sequence of numbers or letters in alphabetical order is the least confusing choice.</para>

<para id="p-svparconfcmd">Sieve parameters should be issued from the configuration only as a matter of convenience, when they are almost always used in sieve runs. But occasionaly the parameter issued from the configuration is not appropriate for the given run. Instead of going to configuration and commenting the parameter out temporarily, it can be cancelled in the command line using the <option>-S</option> option (note capital S) followed by the parameter name. You can use <option>--issued-params</option> option to confirm which parameters will be issued after both the command line and the configuration have been taken into account.</para>

<para><command>check-kde4</command> checks PO files extracted from program code based on KDE4 library and its translation system.

<listitem>
<para>Partly due to historical reasons, and partly due to programmers being sloppy, the original text itself is sometimes not valid by some checks. By default, when the original is not valid, the translation is not expected to be valid either, i.e. it is not checked.

<title><command>check-tp-kde</command></title>

<para>The <ulink url="http://l10n.kde.org/">KDE Translation Project</ulink> contains a great number of PO files extracted from various types of sources. This results in that for each message, there are things that the translation can, must or must not contain, for the translation to be technically valid. When run over PO files within the KDE TP, <command>check-tp-kde</command> will first try to determine the type of each message and then apply appropriate technical checks to it. Message type is determined based on file location, file header, message flags and contexts; even a particular message in a particular file may be checked for some very specific issue.</para>

<para id="p-techprob">"Technical" issues are those which should be fixed regardless of the language and style of translation, because they can lead to loss of functionality, information or presentation to the user. For example, a technical issue would be badly paired XML tags in translation, when in the original they were well paired; a non-technical issue (and thus not checked) would be when the original ends with a certain punctuation, but translation does not -- whether such details are errors or not, depends on the target language and translation style.</para>

<para>For the sieve to function properly, it needs to detect the project subdirectory of each PO file up to topmost division within the branch, e.g. <filename>messages/kdebase</filename> <filename>docmessages/kdegames</filename>. This means that the local copy of the repository tree needs to follow the repository layout up to that point, e.g. <filename>kde-trunk-ui/kdebase</filename> and <filename>kde-trunk-doc/kdegames</filename> would not be valid local paths.</para>

<sect2 id="sv-collect-pmap">
<title><command>collect-pmap</command></title>

<para><emphasis>Property maps</emphasis> (or <emphasis>pmaps</emphasis> for short) are one way in which arbitrary properties of language phrases can be defined for use in scripted translations, such as provided by <ulink url="http://techbase.kde.org/Localization/Concepts/Transcript">Transcript</ulink>, the translation scripting system in KDE 4.</para>

<para>A property map is a text file with a number of entries, each defining the properties of a certain phrase. A pmap entry starts with one or more keys and continues with arbitrary number of key-value properties. An example entry would be grammar declinations of a noun:
<programlisting>
=/Athens/Atina/nom=Atina/gen=Atine/dat=Atini/acc=Atinu//
</programlisting>
The first two characters define, in order, the key-value separator (here <literal>=</literal>) and the property separator (here <literal>/</literal>) for the current entry. The two separators can be any non-alphanumeric characters, and must be different. Then follows a number of entry keys, delimited by property separators, and then a number of key-value properties, each internaly delimited by the key-value separator. The entry is terminated by double property separator. Properties of an entry can be fetched in the translation scripting system by any of the entry keys; keys are case- and whitespace-insensitive.</para>

<para><command>collect-pmap</command> will parse pmap entries from manual comments in messages, collect them, and write out a property map file. It is not necessary to explicitly specify entry keys, since the contents of <varname>msgid</varname> and <varname>msgstr</varname> are automatically added as keys. Since each manual comment is one line, it is also allowed to drop
the final double separator which would normally terminate the entry.
The above example would thus look like this in a PO message:
<programlisting>
# pmap: =/nom=Atina/gen=Atine/dat=Atini/acc=Atinu/
msgctxt "Greece/city"
msgid "Athens"
msgstr "Atina"
</programlisting>
The manual comment starts with <literal>pmap:</literal> keyword, which is followed by a normal pmap entry, except for missing keys (but additional keys can be specified when <varname>msgid</varname> and <varname>msgstr</varname> are not sufficient). It is also possible to split the entry into several comments,
with only condition that all share the same set of separators:
<programlisting>
# pmap: =/nom=Atina/gen=Atine/
# pmap: =/dat=Atini/acc=Atinu/
</programlisting>
After collecting pmap entries from all processed PO files, if two or more entries end up having same keys, they are all removed from the collection and a warning is reported.</para>

<para>Pmap entries are collected only from translated, non-plural messages.</para>

<title>Derivating Entries</title>

<para>There is another, more succint way to define pmap entries in comments. Instead of writting out all key-value combinations, it is possible instead to generate them by using <emphasis>syntagma derivators</emphasis> (or <emphasis>synders</emphasis>) for short. From the earlier example:
<programlisting>
# pmap: =/nom=Atina/gen=Atine/dat=Atini/acc=Atinu/
</programlisting>
it can be observed that each form has the same root, <literal>Atin</literal>, followed by the appropriate ending for that form type. This makes it convenient
to reformulate it as a syntagma derivation:
<programlisting>
# synder: Atin|a
</programlisting>
Here <literal>|a</literal> is a <emphasis>derivator</emphasis>; all derivators are defined in a separate synder file (with <filename>.sd</filename> extension by convention) and made known to the sieve through the <option>derivs</option> parameter. The derivator in this example would be defined like this:
<programlisting>
|a: nom=a, gen=e, dat=i, acc=u
</programlisting>
First comes the derivator name, starting with <literal>|</literal> and ending with <literal>:</literal>, and then the comma-separated list of key-value pairs  similar as in the pmap entry, except that now only the endings for the given form are specified. Synders are actually a standalone subsystem of Pology, see <xref linkend="sec-lgsynder"/> for all details.</para>

<para>It is possible to mix pmap (<literal># pmap: ...</literal>) and synder (<literal># synder: ...</literal>) entries in translator comments. For example, synder entries may be used to cover majority of cases, which follow the general language rules, while pmap entries can be used for exceptions.</para>

<para>On the other hand, every pmap entry can be reformulated as a synder entry which does not refer to an external derivator:
<programlisting>
# synder: nom=Atina, gen=Atine, dat=Atini, acc=Atinu
</programlisting>
This begs the question of what is the need for pmap entries at all, if synder entries can be used in the same capacity and beyond? Pmap entries are still useful because synders have a lot of special syntax and rules to keep in mind (e.g. what if the phrase itself contains a comma?), while raw pmaps have none past what was described above.</para>

<title>Validating Entries</title>

<para>The <literal>propcons</literal> parameter can be used to specify a file which defines constraints on acceptable property keys, and on values by each key. Its format is the following:
<programlisting>
# Full-line comment.
/key_regex_1/value_regex_1/flags # a trailing comment
/key_regex_2/value_regex_2/flags
:key_regex_3:value_regex_3:flags # different separator
# etc.
</programlisting>
Regular expressions for keys and values are delimited by a separator defined by first non-whitespace character in the line, which must also be non-alphanumeric. Before being compiled, regular expressions are automatically wrapped as <literal>^(<replaceable>regex</replaceable>)$</literal>, so that an expression to require a certain prefix is given as <literal><replaceable>prefix</replaceable>.*</literal> and a suffix as <literal>.*<replaceable>suffix</replaceable></literal>. A property key must match one of the key regexs, or else it is considered invalid. Value to that property must then match the value regexes attached to all matched key regexes.</para>

<para>For example, a constraint file defining no constraints on either
property keys or values is:
<programlisting>
/.*/.*/
</programlisting>
while a file explicitly listing all allowed property keys, and constraining values to some of them, would be:
<programlisting>
/nom|gen|dat|acc/.*/
/gender/m|f|n/
/number/s|p/
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>The last separator in the constraint can be followed by a string of single-character flags. These flags are currently defined:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><literal>i</literal>: case-insensitive matching for the value.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><literal>I</literal>: case-insensitive matching for the key.</para>

<listitem>
<para><literal>t</literal>: the value must both match the regular expression and be equal to <varname>msgstr</varname>. If <literal>i</literal> flag is added too, equality check is also case-insensitive.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><literal>r</literal>: regular expression for the key must match at least one key among all defined properties.</para>

<title><command>diff-previous</command></title>

<para>When PO files are merged with <option>--previous</option> option to <command>msgmerge</command>, fuzzy messages will retain the previous version of original text (<varname>msgctxt</varname>, <varname>msgid</varname> and <varname>msgid_plural</varname>) under <literal>#|</literal> comments. Then <command>diff-previous</command> can be used to embedded differences from previous to current original into previous original strings. For example, the message:
<programlisting>
#: main.c:110
#, fuzzy
#| msgid "The Record of The Witch River"
msgid "Records of The Witch River"
msgstr "Beleška o Veštičjoj reci"
</programlisting>
will become after sieving:
<programlisting>
#: main.c:110
#, fuzzy
#| msgid "{-The Record-}{+Records+} of The Witch River"
msgid "Records of The Witch River"
msgstr "Beleška o Veštičjoj reci"
</programlisting>
Text editors may even provide highlighting for the wrapped difference segments
(e.g. Kwrite/Kate).</para>

<para>This sieve is very useful if your PO editor does not show differences in the original by itself.

<title><command>fancy-quote</command></title>

<para>Ordinary ASCII quotes are easy to type on most keyboard layouts, and these quotes are frequently encountered in non-typeset English texts, rather than proper English quotes. These proper quotes are sometimes called "fancy" quotes. When translating from English, translators can thus be easily moved to use ASCII quotes themselves, instead of the fancy quotes appropriate for their language. To somewhat correct this, <command>fancy-quote</command> can be used to replace ASCII quotes in the translation with selected pairs of fancy quotes.</para>

<para>ASCII quotes that are part of text markup (e.g. attribute values in XML-like tags) must not be replaced, and this sieve will use heuristics to determine such places.

<sect2 id="sv-find-messages">
<title><command>find-messages</command></title>

<para><command>find-messages</command> is the search and replace workhorse of Pology. It applies one or several conditions to different parts of the PO message, with selectable boolean linking between them. If the message is matched as whole, it is reported and possibly some replacements are done. Messages are by default reported to standard output, with full location reference (PO file path, line and entry number), but can also be opened directly in one of supported PO editors (see <xref linkend="sec-cmsupped"/>).</para>

<para>When used in a sieve chain, <command>find-messages</command> will stop further sieving of messages which did not satisfy the conditions. This makes it useful as a filter for selecting subsets of messages on which other sieves should operate.</para>

<para>There are three logical groups of parameters: matching parameters, replacement parameters, and general parameters. Matching and replacement parameters have certain relationships between themselves, while general parameters have mutually independent effects (i.e. as usual for sieve parameters).</para>

<sect3 id="sec-svfmmpar">
<title>Matching Parameters</title>

<para>Matching parameters specify patterns for matching by parts of the message, or represent binary conditions (whether the message is translated, etc.). For example:
<programlisting>
$ posieve find-messages -s msgid:'foo bar'
</programlisting>
will report all messages which contain the phrase "foo bar" in their <varname>msgid</varname> (or <varname>msgid_plural</varname>) string. When several matching parameters are given, by default the message is matched if all patterns match; that is, boolean linking of conditions is AND. This:
<programlisting>
$ posieve find-messages -s msgid:'foo bar' -s transl
</programlisting>
will report all messages that contain "foo bar" in original <emphasis>and</emphasis> are translated. Boolean linking can be switched to OR by issuing the <option>or</option> parameter. To find all messages that contain the word "tooltip" in <emphasis>either</emphasis> context or comments:
<programlisting>
$ posieve find-messages -s msgctxt:tooltip -s comment:tooltip -s or
</programlisting>
(Actually, the effect of <option>or</option> is somewhat more specific, see its description below.) String matching is by default case insensitive, which can be changed globally by issuing the <option>case</option> parameter.</para>

<para>Every matching parameter has a negative counterpart, named by prepending <literal>n</literal> to the original parameter, which matches when the original parameter does not. Running:
<programlisting>
$ posieve find-messages -s msgid:'hello' -s nmsgstr:'zdravo'
</programlisting>
would find all messages that contain "hello" in the original and do <emphasis>not</emphasis> contain "zdravo" in the translation (a typical usage pattern in quick terminology checks).</para>

<para>To find all messages not matching a set of conditions, in principle it would be possible to negate the whole condition set by switching between positive/negative parameters and AND/OR-linking, but this can be cumbersome. Instead, the <option>invert</option> parameter can be issued to report messages that are not matched by the condition set.</para>

<para>Sometimes neither simple AND nor simple OR boolean linking is sufficient to form the search. Therefore the <option>fexpr</option> parameter is provided, which can be used to specify a search expression with explicit boolean operators and parentheses for controlling the evaluation order. With <option>fexpr</option>, the previous example could be reformulated as:
<programlisting>
$ posieve find-messages -s fexpr:'msgid/hello/ and not msgstr/zdravo/'
</programlisting>
For details, see the description of <option>fexpr</option> below.</para>

<sect3 id="sec-svfmrpar">
<title>Replacement Parameters</title>

<para>Replacement is done in pair with matching the appropriate string in the message. For example, to replace each appearance of "foobar" with "fumbar" in translation, this would be run:
<programlisting>
$ posieve find-messages -s msgstr:foobar -s replace:fumbar
</programlisting>
The <option>replace</option> parameter works in pair with <option>msgstr</option>, i.e. <option>replace</option> cannot be issued without issuing <option>msgstr</option> as well. There are two possible problems with replacement as straightforward as this. The first is that if "foobar" was a whole word (or start of a word), and this word in the text started with upper-case letter, the replacement would make it lower-case. This can be avoided by executing replacement twice with case sensitivity:
<programlisting>
$ posieve find-messages -s msgstr:foobar -s replace:fumbar -scase
$ posieve find-messages -s msgstr:Foobar -s replace:Fumbar -scase
</programlisting>
The other problem is if the word is split by an accelerator marker, for example:
<programlisting>
msgstr "... f_oobar ..."
</programlisting>
The search may still find the word (see the <option>accel</option> parameter below), but direct replacement would cause the loss of accelerator marker, and therefore it is not done.<footnote>
<para>Some heuristics for reinsertion of the accelerator marker may be implemented in the future.</para>
</footnote> To see such cases, you should monitor the output of <command>find-messages</command> (always a good idea when doing batch replacement), where matched and replaced parts of the text will be highlighted.</para>

<para>As usual for replacement based on regular expression, the replacement string may contain <literal>\<replaceable>number</replaceable></literal> references to groups defined in the matching pattern. For example, the previous example of case-aware replacement could be more efficiently and more elegantly performed with:
<programlisting>
$ posieve find-messages -s msgstr:'(f)oobar' -s replace:'\1umbar'
</programlisting>
(Though this is possible only if the original and the replacement start with the same letter.)</para>

<title><command>normctxt-delim</command></title>

<para>In older PO files, disambiguating contexts may be embedded into <varname>msgid</varname> strings, as the initial part of the string delimited from the actual text with predefined substrings, here called the "head" and the "tail". For example, in:
<programlisting>
msgid ""
"_:this-is-context\n"
"This is original text"
msgstr "This is translated text"
</programlisting>
the head is the underscore-colon sequence (<literal>_:</literal>), and the tail the newline (<literal>\n</literal>). <command>normctxt-delim</command> will convert embedded contexts of the delimiter-type to proper <varname>msgctxt</varname> strings.</para>

<title><command>remove-fuzzy-comments</command></title>

<para>Being translator's input, translator comments are copied verbatim to fuzzy messages created on merging with template. Depending on the purpose of translator comments (e.g. see <xref linkend="sec-cmskipcheck"/> for some special types), it may be better to automatically remove some of them from fuzzy messages (and then possibly add them back manually when updating the translation). If run without any parameters <command>remove-fuzzy-comments</command> will do nothing, so one or more parameters need to be given to actually remove any comment.</para>

<sect2 id="sv-resolve-aggregates">
<title><command>resolve-aggregates</command></title>

<para>In its default mode of operation, <command>msgcat(1)</command> produces an aggregate message when in different catalogs it encounters a message with the same key but different translation or translator or extracted comments. A general aggregate message looks like this:
<programlisting>
# #-#-#-#-#  po-file-name-1 (project-version-id-1)  #-#-#-#-#

Each message part is aggregated only if different in at least one message
in the group. For example, extracted comments may be aggregated while translations not.</para>

<para><command>resolve-aggregates</command> is used to resolve aggregate messages of this kind into normal messages, by picking one variant from each aggregated part.</para>

<para>Parameters:
<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><option>first</option></term>
<listitem>
<para>By default, the picked variant is the one with most occurences, or the first of the several with same number of occurences. If this parameter is issued, the first variant is picked unconditionally.</para>

<varlistentry>
<term><option>unfuzzy</option></term>
<listitem>
<para>Aggregated messages are always made fuzzy, leaving no way to determine
if and which of the original messages were fuzzy. Therefore, by default, the resolved message is left fuzzy too. If, however, it is known beforehand that none of the original messages were fuzzy, resolved messages can be unfuzzied by issuing this parameter.</para>

<sect2 id="sv-resolve-alternatives">
<title><command>resolve-alternatives</command></title>

<para><command>resolve-alternatives</command> resolves <emphasis>alternatives directives</emphasis> found in the translation into one of the alternatives.</para>

<para>An alternative directive is a substring of the form <literal>~@/.../.../...</literal>, for example:
<programlisting>
msgstr "I see a ~@/pink/white/ elephant."
</programlisting>
<literal>~@</literal> is the directive head, which is followed by a character that defines the delimiter of alternatives (can be arbitrary), and then by alternatives themselves. The number of alternatives per directive is not defined by the directive itself, but it is provided as the sieve parameter (i.e. all alternative directives must have some number of alternatives).</para>

<para>Parameters:
<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><option>alt:<replaceable>N</replaceable>,<replaceable>M</replaceable>t</option></term>
<listitem>
<para>Specifies how to resolve alternatives. <literal><replaceable>N</replaceable></literal> is the index (starting from 1) of the alternative to take from each directive, and <literal><replaceable>M</replaceable></literal> is the number of alternatives per directive. Example: <literal>alt:1,2t</literal>.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<para>Fuzzy messages are often very easy to correct (e.g. a typo fixed), which may make their word count misleading when estimating translation effort.

The split is based on the difference ratio between current and previous original text, and a threshold. If the difference ratio is larger than the threshold, everything is counted as untranslated. The fuzzy count is left at zero. If previous original text is missing, the correction is not made, and counts are assigned to fuzzy as usual.</para>

<sect3 id="sec-svstemctxt">
<title>Handling Embedded Contexts</title>

<para>Some older PO files will have disambiguating contexts embedded into the <varname>msgid</varname> string, instead of using the newer standard <varname>msgctxt</varname> string. There are several customary ways in which this is done, but in general it depends on the translation environment where such PO files are used.</para>

<para>Embedded contexts will skew the statistics. Pology contains several sieves for converting embedded contexts into <varname>msgctxt</varname> contexts, named <command>normctxt-*</command>. When statistics on such PO files is computed, a sieve chain should be used in which the <command>stats</command> sieve is preceeded by the context conversion sieve. For example, if the embedded context starts the <varname>msgid</varname> and ends with <literal>|</literal>, statistics should be computed with:
<programlisting>
$ posieve --no-sync normctxt-sep,stats -s sep:'|' ...
</programlisting>
Note that <command>normctxt-*</command> sieves, since they modify messages, would by default cause PO files to be modified on disk. Option <option>--no-sync</option> is therefore issued to prevent modifications to sieved files.</para>

<para>The output with <option>detail</option> parameter in effect is the same as default, with several columns of derived data appended to the table:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><literal>w-ef</literal>: word expansion factor (increase in words from the original to the translation)</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><literal>ch-ef</literal>: character expansion factor (increase in characters from the original to the translation)</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><literal>w/msg-or</literal>: average of number words per message in the original</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><literal>w/msg-tr</literal>: average number of words per message in the translation</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><literal>ch/w-or</literal>: average number of characters per message in the original</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><literal>ch/w-tr</literal>: average number of characters per message in the translation</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>If any of the sieve parameters that restrict or modify counting (such as <option>ondiff</option>, <option>lspan</option>, etc.) have been issued, this is indicated in the output by a <literal>modifiers: ...</literal> line:
<programlisting>
$ posieve stats -s maxwords:5 -s ondiff frobaz/
(...the statistics table...)
modifiers: at most 5 words and scaled fuzzy counts
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>When the <option>incomplete</option> parameter is given, the statistics table is followed by a table of non-fully translated PO files, with counts of fuzzy and untranslated messages and words:
<programlisting>
$ posieve stats -s incomplete frobaz/
(...the overall statistics table...)
catalog              msg/f   msg/u   msg/f+u   w/f   w/u   w/f+u
frobaz/foxtrot.po        0      11        11     0   123     123
frobaz/november.po      19      14        33    85    47     132
frobaz/sierra.po        22       0        22   231     0     231
</programlisting>
In the column names, <literal>msg/*</literal> and <literal>w/*</literal> stand for messages and words; <literal>*/f</literal>, <literal>*/u</literal>, and <literal>*/f+u</literal> stand for fuzzy, untranslated, and the two summed.</para>

<para>When parameters <option>msgbar</option> or <option>wbar</option> are in effect, statistics is presented in the form of a text-art bar, giving visual relation between numbers of translated, fuzzy, and untranslated messages or words:
<programlisting>
$ posieve stats -s wbar frobaz/
4572/1829/2533 w-or |¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤×××××××××············|
</programlisting>
A typical condensed overview of translation state is obtained by:
<programlisting>
$ posieve stats -s byfile -s msgbar frobaz/
frobaz/foxtrot.po   34/ -/11 msgs |¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤·····|
frobaz/november.po  58/19/14 msgs |¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤×××××····|
frobaz/sierra.po    65/22/ - msgs |¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤××××××|
(overall)          147/41/25 msgs |¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤××××···|
</programlisting>
Note that while message counts are the classic for bar overviews (<option>msgbar</option>), you are probably better off looking at word counts (<option>wbar</option>) instead, because word counts represent more closely the amount of work needed to complete the translation. Rounding of fractions for bars is such that as long as there is at least one fuzzy or untranslated message (or word), the bar will show one incomplete cell.</para>

<sect3 id="sec-svstnotes">
<title>Notes on Counting</title>

<para>Word and character counts for a message string are obtained by processing it in the following order:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Accelerator markers are removed.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Text markup is eliminated (e.g. XML-like tags).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Other special substrings, such as format directives, are also eliminated (e.g. <literal>%s</literal> in messages with <literal>c-format</literal> flag).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Text is split into words by taking all contiguous sequences of "word characters", which include letters, numbers, and underscore.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>All words not starting with a letter are eliminated.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Words that remain are counted into statistics. Whitespace is not included in character count.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>In plural messages, counts for the original are the average of <varname>msgid</varname> and <varname>msgid_plural</varname> strings, and likewise the average of all <varname>msgstr</varname> strings for the translation. In this way, the comparative statistics between the original and the translation is not skewed for languages that have more or less than two plural forms.</para>

</sect3>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="sv-tag-untranslated">
<title><command>tag-untranslated</command></title>

<para>Some translators like to edit PO files with a plain text editor, which may provide no special support for editing PO files, other than perhaps PO syntax highlighting. In this scenario, <command>tag-untranslated</command> can be used to equip untranslated messages with <literal>untranslated</literal> flag, so that they can be easily looked up in the editor.</para>

<para>Since <literal>untranslated</literal> is not one of defined PO flags, it will be lost if the PO file is merged with the template. This is intentional: the only purpose of this flag is to facilitate immediate editing of the PO file, and you may miss to remove some of them while editing. There is no reason for <literal>untranslated</literal> flags to persist in that case. Also, if the flag is not removed after the message has been translated, a subsequent run of this sieve will remove the flag.</para>

<para>Parameters:
<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><option>strip</option></term>
<listitem>
<para>Instead of being added, <literal>untranslated</literal> flags are stripped. This is useful when you had no time to translate all messages but you want to send the PO file away.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><option>wfuzzy</option></term>
<listitem>
<para><literal>untranslated</literal> flags are added to fuzzy messages as well. This can be useful to be able to jump in the text editor through all incomplete message by just giving <userinput>, untranslated</userinput><footnote>
<para>Alternatively, if the editor provides regular expressions for searches, you can search for <userinput>, fuzzy|, untranslated</userinput>.</para>
</footnote>, or when the set of messages to be updated has been limited somehow (e.g. by the <option>branch</option> parameter).</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><option>branch:<replaceable>branch</replaceable></option></term>
<listitem>
<para>Tag only untranslated messages from given branch (<link linkend="ch-summit">summit</link>). Several branches may be given as comma-separated list.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="sv-unfuzzy-context-only">
<title><command>unfuzzy-context-only</command></title>

<para>Sometimes the message is made fuzzy during merging only due to change in the <varname>msgctxt</varname> string, or its addition or removal. Some translators and languages may be less dependent on contexts than the other, or they may be in a hurry prior to the release of the translation, and then <command>unfuzzy-context-only</command> can be used to unfuzzy these messages in which only the context was modified. This state can be detected by comparing the current and the previous strings in the fuzzy message, i.e. the PO file must have been merged with <option>--previous</option> option to <command>msgmerge</command>.</para>

<para>Parameters:
<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><option>noreview</option></term>
<listitem>
<para>By default, unfuzzied messages will also be given a translator comment
with <literal>unreviewed-context</literal> string, so that you may find and review these messages at a later time. This parameter will prevent the addition of such comment, but it is usually safer to review automatically unfuzzied messages when you find the time.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><option>eqmsgid</option></term>
<listitem>
<para>Sometimes a lot of messages in the code may be semi-automatically equipped with contexts (e.g. to group items by a common property), and then it may be necessary to review only those messages which got split into two or more messages due to newly added contexts. This parameter may be issued to specifically report all translated messages which have the their <varname>msgid</varname> string equal to an unfuzzied message, including unfuzzied messages themselves. Depending on exactly what kind of contexts have been added, the <option>noreview</option> parameter may be useful here as well.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><option>lokalize</option></term>
<listitem>
<para>Open the PO file on reported messages in Lokalize. Lokalize must be already running with the project that contains the PO file opened.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="sv-unfuzzy-ctxmark-only">
<title><command>unfuzzy-ctxmark-only</command></title>

<para><command>unfuzzy-ctxmark-only</command> has a similar but less wide effect compared to the <command>unfuzzy-context-only</command> sieve. It unfuzzies a message only if the only change that caused fuzzyness is in a specific part of <varname>msgctxt</varname> string, the <emphasis>UI context marker</emphasis>.</para>

<para>UI context markers are en element of <ulink url="http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Localization/i18n_Semantics">KUIT markup</ulink> (KDE user interface text), which state more formally the user interface context in which the text given by the PO message is used. This may be important for translation, since style guidelines will typically somewhat depend on where in the UI the text is seen. For example, there may be two messages in the code which have exactly the same text in English, but one is used as a menu item, and the other as a dialog title; with KUIT, they would be marked as:
<programlisting>
msgctxt "@action:inmenu File"
msgid "Export as HTML"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "@title:window"
msgid "Export as HTML"
msgstr ""
</programlisting>
The UI context marker here is the leading part of <varname>msgctxt</varname>, starting with <literal>@...</literal> and ending with first whitespace. <command>unfuzzy-ctxmark-only</command> will unfuzzy the message if only this marker has changed (or was added or removed), but not if the change was in the rest of the context (after the first whitespace).</para>

<para>Parameters:
<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><option>noreview</option></term>
<listitem>
<para>See the same-name parameter of <command>unfuzzy-ctxmark-only</command>. Using it here is probably somewhat safer, but this in general it depends on translation style guidelines.</para>
</listitem>

</variablelist>
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="sv-unfuzzy-inplace-only">
<title><command>unfuzzy-inplace-only</command></title>

<para>Some text markups may have a "permissible" or "sloppy" mode, where some tags do not have to be explicitly terminated. The typical example is HTML, where <literal>&lt;br&gt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;hr&gt;</literal>, etc. do not have to be written as <literal>&lt;br/&gt;</literal>. (This is unlike XHTML, which is an XML instance and therefore strict in this respect.) When this permissible markup was used in the code, a programmer revisiting that code at a later time may consider it a poor style, and go about fixing it. This may cause some messages in the PO file to become fuzzy. <command>unfuzzy-inplace-only</command> will recognize some of these situations in a fuzzy message (by comparing the current and previous strings) and automatically modify the translation accordingly and unfuzzy the message.</para>

<para>There are no parameters.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="sv-update-header">
<title><command>update-header</command></title>

<para>When translation on a PO file starts for the first time, or when a previously translated PO file is being updated after merging, <command>update-header</command> can be used to automatically set and update PO header fields to proper values. The revision date is taken as current, while other pieces of information are read from the user configuration (see <xref linkend="sec-cmconfig"/>). Note that this sieve is normally only of use when you are translating with a plain text editor, while dedicated PO editors should do this automatically when the PO file is saved after editing.</para>

<para>Parameters:
<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><option>proj:<replaceable>projectid</replaceable></option></term>
<listitem>
<para>The ID of the project to which the PO files to be updated belong. This ID is used to construct the name of the configuration section as <literal>[project-<replaceable>projectid</replaceable>]</literal>, which contains the project data fields. Also used are the fields from the <literal>[user]</literal>, whenever they are not overriden in project's section. See <xref linkend="sec-cmcfguser"/> and <xref linkend="sec-cmcfgproj"/>.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><option>init</option></term>
<listitem>
<para>By default, the sieve tries to detect if the header has been initialized before or not, because it differs somewhat what should be changed in the header on initialization and on update. This parameter can be issued to unconditionally treat the header as not initialized, i.e. overwrite any existing content.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><option>onmod</option></term>
<listitem>
<para>The header should be updated only if the PO file was otherwise modified. This parameter makes sense only in a sieve chane, when this sieve is preceded by a potentially modifying sieve.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>
</para>

<para>An example of a user configuration appropriate for this sieve would be:
<programlisting>
[user]
name = Chusslove Illich
original-name = Часлав Илић
email = caslav.ilic@gmx.net
po-editor = Kate

[project-kde]
language = sr
language-team = Serbian
team-email = kde-i18n-sr@kde.org
plural-forms = nplurals=4; plural=n==1 ? 3 : n%%10==1 &amp;&amp; \
               n%%100!=11 ? 0 : n%%10>=2 &amp;&amp; n%%10&lt;=4 &amp;&amp; \
               (n%%100&lt;10 || n%%100>=20) ? 1 : 2;
</programlisting>
Note that percent characters in the <literal>plural-forms</literal> field are escaped by doubling, because single <literal>%</literal> in configuration has special meaning. Also note splitting into several lines by trailing <literal>\</literal> (only for better looks, since configuration lines can be arbitrarily long).</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="sv-fr:setUbsp">
<title><command>fr:setUbsp</command></title>

<para>In French language, some punctuation characters are separated with a certain amount of whitespace from the preceding word. This is unlike in English, so unwary French translators sometimes miss to add the required space before such punctuation when translating from English. <command>fr:setUbsp</command> will heuristically detect such places and insert the space.</para>

<para>There are no parameters.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="sv-ru:fill-doc-date-kde">
<title><command>ru:fill-doc-date-kde</command></title>

<para>Each translation file for a docbook in KDE has a string for documentation last update date in the format 'yyyy-mm-dd'. This sieve automatically translated those strings into Russian. The sieve uses <command>date</command> command in order to change date formatting. But Russian names of months are hardcoded, so that you do not need to set up Russian locale to use the sieve.</para>

<para>There are no parameters.</para>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<sect1 id="sec-svexternal">
<title>Using External Sieves</title>

<para>Each internal sieve is a single Python file in <filename>sieve/</filename> subdirectory (and in <filename>lang/<replaceable>langcode</replaceable>/sieve/</filename> for language-specific sieves). The Python file is named like the sieve, only with hyphens replaced with underscores and with <filename>.py</filename> extension. <command>posieve</command> therefore knows how to find which file to execute when an internal sieve name is given as its first argument.</para>

<para>However, instead of an internal sieve name, the first argument to <command>posieve</command> can also be an explicit path (relative or absolute) to a Python file which implements a sieve. Explicit paths can also be part of a sieve chain, mixed with internal sieve names. This is all there is to running external sieves; see <xref linkend="sec-prsieves"/> for instructions on how to write one.</para>
