Pology
======


What Is This?
-------------

Pology is a Python library and collection of scripts for in-depth processing
of PO files, which are the predominant medium for translation of free software
and associated documents.

Pology is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3.


Obtaining
---------

Pology is still not released, so it is likely not available through operating
system's package manager. The latest development version can be obtained and
kept up to date from the Subversion repository at:

  $ cd <somewhere>
  $ svn checkout svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/l10n-support/pology
  $ svn update pology


Installing
----------

Pology can be used either installed or directly from its source directory.

To install Pology into default installation prefix, execute

  $ cd <pology-source>
  $ mkdir build && cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make && make install

CMake, the build system, will notify you of any missing requirements
and provide notes about the command line options that you can use
to customize the build (e.g. installation prefix, etc).
Note that if you install Pology outside of default installation prefix,
you may need to make modify the environment as listed below.

To use Pology directly from the source directory, you only need to
set some environment variables (in Bash):

  $ export PYTHONPATH=<pology-source>:$PYTHONPATH
  $ export PATH=<pology-source>/bin:$PATH

For convenience, you can activate shell completion for Pology scripts.
If you have installed Pology, then (in Bash):

  $ . <pology-install-prefix>/share/pology/completion/bash/pology

and if running from source directory:

  $ . <pology-source>/completion/bash/pology
