    Highlight spans in text.

    Adds shell colors around defined spans in the text.
    Spans are given as list of index tuples C{[(start1, end1), ...]} where
    start and end index have standard Python semantics.
    Span tuples can have more than two elements, with indices followed by
    additional elements, which are ignored by this function.

    If C{ftext} is not C{None} spans are understood as relative to it,
    and the function will try to adapt them to the main text
    (see L{pology.misc.diff.adapt_spans}).
