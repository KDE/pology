This is the translation domain for Pology user interface strings.
PO files should be named LANGCODE.po (e.g. de.po, fr.po).
When a new PO file is introduced, its language code must be added
to LINGUAS file in this directory or else it will not get installed.

Running the update-po.sh without arguments will do the following:

  - extract the catalog template
  - merge all translations
  - compile translations

Each of this phases can be run separately by giving as argument one of:
extract, merge, compile. When merge or compile phase are run,
the second argument can be the particular language code on which to operate
(by default all PO files are processed, irrespective of LINGUAS file). 

Compiled catalogs are put into ../../mo, using proper locale hierarchy
such that they get picked up automatically by Pology scripts
when run directly from the repository (without installing).
Compiled catalogs and ../../mo subdirectory are ignored by version control.

Run periodically to bring updated translations into action, possibly in the
compile-only mode if you do not want to touch template and translations.
