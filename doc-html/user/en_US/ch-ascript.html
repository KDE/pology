<p>It may not be obvious, especially to new translators, to which extent the translation needs to be reviewed. If the translator has exercised due diligence, how "wrong" can the translation be? Even if the translator has good command of the source language -- typically English in context of PO files -- the answer is "very wrong", all aspects considered.</p>
<p>With comparatively simple grammar of English, the meaning of a short English sentence (as typically encountered in program user interfaces) may vary much depend on the surrounding context. This context may not be obvious when the translator is going through isolated messages in the PO file, so he may commit the worst of errors from the reader's viewpoint: the senseless translation. An experienced reviewer will have developed sense for troublesome contexts, and will have at disposal several means to conclusively determine the context (including, for example, running the development version of the program).</p>
<p>Even if the context is correctly established, the translator may use "wrong" terminology, which is the next worse thing for the reader. A term used in translation does not need to be wrong by itself, in fact it may be exactly the correct term -- in another translation project. The reviewer will have more experience with terminology of the present project, and be able to bring the translation in line with it.</p>
<p>Style in the technical sense is a consistent choice between several perfectly valid constructs in target language when applied to text in the given technical context. For example, how to translate menu titles and items, button labels, or tooltips in user interface. Choices may include noun or verb forms, particular grammar categories, tone of address, and so on. There may be a style guide to the project which details such choices, and the reviewer will know it well.</p>
<p>Style in the linguistic sense is especially applicable to longer texts, such as tooltips in user interface or paragraphs in documentation. A typical error of a new translator is to closely adhere to English style and grammar. This may produce translation which is semantically and grammatically valid in the target language, but very out of style. Reviewer then steps in to naturalize such constructs.</p>
<p>Finally, while the reviewer may be an experienced translator, that does not mean that his own translations need no review. Immersion into the source language, distraction, and fatigue, will lead the reviewer into any of the above errors in translation, only with lesser frequency. This means that reviewers should also mutually review their own translations.</p>
<p>This calls for a systematic approach to review in translation workflow.</p>

<h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sec-ascrevcomp" id="sec-ascrevcomp"></a>6.1.&nbsp;Review Stages vs. Ascription</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Classical review workflow, <span class="emphasis"><em>by stages</em></span>, seems simple enough. Translator translates a new PO file or updates an existing translation, and declares it ready to review. A reviewer reviews it, and declares it ready to commit into the pool from which PO files are periodically released. A committer finally commits the file. The process is iterative: the reviewer may return the file to the translator, and translator later again declare it as ready for review. There may be several stages of review (such as <span class="emphasis"><em>proof-reading</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>approving</em></span>), each of which may return the translation to a previous stage, or forward it to some special stage. The process may also be implemented on the subfile level, where each PO message can go through stages separately.</p>
<p>Regardless of the technical details, review workflows of this kind all have the following in common. Members of the translation team are assigned <span class="emphasis"><em>roles</em></span> (such as <span class="emphasis"><em>translator</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>reviewer</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>committer</em></span>) by which they step into the workflow. A single person can have more roles. Later review stages must wait for the earlier stages to complete, and the translation cannot be updated again before the current version clears the review pipeline (or the pipeline is aborted). Once the translation is committed, it becomes a part of simply "admitted" translations, with no further qualifiers.</p>
<p>The system of prescribed roles requires that team members assign the roles between themselves, stick to them, and shuffle them along the way. The prescribed review pipeline requires a tool to keep track of the current review stage of translation. This makes the review workflow rigid, with probable bottlenecks. Distribution of roles may become disbalanced by people coming into and leaving the team, or the tracking tool may be prohibitive to some scenarios (e.g. single translator making small adjustments in dozens of files across the project, but having to upload each manually through a web interface).</p>
<p>"Rigid" and "inefficient" are comparative qualifications, so what is it that review by stages can be compared to in this way?</p>
<p>Review <span class="emphasis"><em>by ascriptions</em></span> is even simpler conceptually, and yet less rigid and more efficient than the review by stages. It obligatory works on the PO message level, rather than PO file level. Anyone can simply translate some PO messages and directly commit modified PO files, without any review, but <span class="emphasis"><em>ascribing</em></span> modifications to own name. Anyone can review any PO message at any moment, commit modifications made during the review, and ascribe the review to own name (and possibly to a certain class -- review of context, of terminology, style, etc). When the time comes to release the translation, <span class="emphasis"><em>insufficiently</em></span> reviewed messages are automatically omitted, by evaluating the <span class="emphasis"><em>ascription history</em></span> of each message.</p>
<p>Based on the ascription history, the reviewer can select a subset of PO messages, and review only the difference between their historical and current versions. For example, Alice can select to review only messages modified since she or Bob had last reviewed them for style. She could see the difference from that last review to current version, e.g. if in the whole paragraph only a single word was changed by Charlie when he reviewed the terminology. Ascription history also propagate through merging of PO files with templates, so the reviewer can compare the change in original to the change in translation since the last review and judge if one fits the other.</p>
<p>Since everyone just commits, translations can be efficiently kept in a version control repository, with the ascription system added on top. After having done some translating, the translator simply substitutes commit command of the version control system (VCS) with "ascribe modifications" command of the ascription system (AS, which calls the underlying VCS internally). After reviewing, the reviewer uses "ascribe reviews" command of the AS to commit reviews to ascription history (as well as any modifications made during the review). To select messages for review, the reviewer issues "diff for review" command of the AS, with suitable parameters to narrow the message set; selected messages are marked in-place in PO files and equipped with <a class="link" href="ch-diffpatch.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Diffing and Patching">embedded differences</a>, and possibly directly opened in a PO editor.</p>
<p><a name="p-asrel" id="p-asrel"></a>When the translations are to be released, the release person issues "filter for release" command of the AS, which takes the working PO files and creates final PO files, in which the insufficiently reviewed messages are removed. Here "release time" can be understood figuratively: since filtering for release should be a fully automatic process, it can be performed at any interval of convenience.</p>
<p>What constitutes "sufficient review" can be defined in fine detail. It could be specified that messages modified by Alice need to have only review for terminology, but not necessarily for style; Charlie may belong to the group which needs to be reviewed on style, but not necessarily on context; Bob's reviews for style may be nice to have, but never blocking the release if missing. These decisions do not preclude released messages to be reviewed later on missing points, after higher priority reviews have been completed. The definition of sufficiency may be changed at any point, e.g. as team members get more experienced and require less review, without interfering with direct translation and review activities.</p>
<p>In summary, an AS preserves the operational efficiency of VCS, while at the same time providing great flexibility of review. All team members can be given commit access, no web or email detours are needed. There are no prescribed roles, but a functional equivalent of role assignment happens at the last possible moment (release time), can take into account both translators' and reviewers' abilities, and changing estimates of those over time. There is no staging between completing and committing the translation, which enables a translator to continue polishing the translation undisturbed until a reviewer comes around. There are no bottlenecks when performing small changes in many files, since a single AS command commits all changes just as a single VCS command would. On commit operations, the AS can also apply various checks (e.g. decline to commit syntactically invalid PO files) and modifications (e.g. update translator's data in the PO header).</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Pology provides an ascription system in the form of the <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> command.</p>
<p>Let the organization of PO files for the language <code class="literal">nn</code> in the version control repository be such:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
l10n-nn/
    po/
        ui/
            alpha.po
            bravo.po
            ...
        doc/
            alpha.po
            bravo.po
            ...
        ...
</pre>
<p>Having PO files grouped by language can be taken as a hard prerequisite<sup>[<a name="id367573" href="#ftn.id367573" class="footnote" id="id367573">24</a>]</sup>. Also necessary is a single top subdirectory for the whole PO file tree (here <code class="filename">po/</code>), rather than having several PO subdirectories directly in the language directory.</p>
<p>Setting up ascription is now simple. Create the ascription configuration file named exactly <code class="filename">ascription-config</code> (<span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> expects this name), on the same level as the top PO directory:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
l10n-nn/
    ascription-config
    po/
        ui/
            ...
        doc/
            ...
</pre>
<p>and set in it a few global configuration fields, and data for each known translator:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
# ---------------------------
# Global ascription settings.

[global]

# Roots of the original and ascription trees.
catalog-root = po
ascript-root = po-ascript

# The underlying version control system.
version-control = svn

# Data for updating PO headers on request.
language = nn
language-team = Nevernissian
team-email = l10n-nn@neverwhere.org

# Default commit message.
commit-message = Translation updates.

# -----------------------
# Registered translators.

[user-alice]

[user-bob]
name = Bob Bromkin
original-name = Бобан Бромкин
email = bob.byomkin@otherplacenice.org

# ...and so on.
</pre>
<p>The configuration fields used in this example, and other possible configuration fields, are listed and described below.</p>
<p>Global settings in the configuration file:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">catalog-root</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The path to top PO subdirectory. This should be a relative path, and relative to the location of the configuration file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">ascript-root</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Relative path to the top directory of <a class="link" href="ch-ascript.html#p-ascftree">the ascription file tree</a>, which will be created and updated by <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">version-control</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The underlying version control system of the repository. The value is a keyword, see <a class="xref" href="ch-common.html#sec-cmsuppvcs" title="9.7.2.&nbsp;Version Control Systems">Section&nbsp;9.7.2, “Version Control Systems”</a> for a list of VCS supported by Pology.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">language</code>,</span> <span class="term"><code class="literal">language-team</code>,</span> <span class="term"><code class="literal">team-email</code>,</span> <span class="term"><code class="literal">plural-header</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>These fields provide information about the language and the translation team, which <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> uses to update header fields in modified PO files. <code class="literal">language</code> is the language code, while <code class="literal">language-team</code> is usually just the human-readable language name in English. <code class="literal">plural-header</code> is the exact contents of <code class="literal">Plural-Forms:</code> PO header field (if it contains a <code class="literal">%</code> character, you need to escape it as <code class="literal">%%</code>). For any of these fields that is not set, <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> will remove the corresponding header field when updating the PO header.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">title</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The first comment line in the PO header, set when <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> updates the header. It can contain the following placeholders for inserting file-dependent information: <code class="literal">%basename</code> is the base PO file name (e.g. <code class="literal">alpha.po</code>), <code class="literal">%poname</code> the PO domain name (e.g. <code class="literal">alpha</code>), <code class="literal">%langname</code> the human-readable language name (supplied by the <code class="literal">language-team</code> field), and <code class="literal">%langcode</code> the language code (supplied by the <code class="literal">language</code> field). Note that these placeholders actually must be written as <code class="literal">%%<em class="replaceable"><code>name</code></em></code>, to escape the special meaning of single <code class="literal">%</code> character. If <code class="literal">title</code> field is not set, <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> will leave the title comment as it is in the PO file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">commit-message</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The default commit message for the underlying VCS, when <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> calls upon it to commit modified PO files. If this field is not set, an editor window will pop up to input the commit message, or the <code class="option">-m</code>/<code class="option">--message</code> option can be used to set the message through the command line. If the field is set, <code class="option">-m</code> can still be used to override the default commit message.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">review-tags</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The set of accepted <a class="link" href="ch-ascript.html#sec-ascfgrev" title="6.4.3.&nbsp;Fine-Grained Reviews">review tags</a>, given as whitespace-separated list of tags. If set, <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> will abort when trying to use an unknown tag, otherwise it will accept any tag.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Each known translator is represented by a <code class="literal">[user-<em class="replaceable"><code>name</code></em>]</code> configuration section. Translator's user name in the ascription system has no direct relation with the underlying VCS account name (if VCS uses them), but it makes sense for them to be equal. This also means that a translator does not even have to have VCS account (repository commit access), though this is expected for the sake of efficiency. Translator configuration sections can contain the following fields:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">name</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Translator's name, in the form supposed to be readable in English. This means that if the name is not originally written in Latin script, some romanized form should be given.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">original-name</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Translator's name in its original form, if it differs from the romanized form given by the <code class="literal">name</code> field.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">email</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The email address at which the translator may be contacted.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>As soon as <code class="filename">ascription-config</code> file is committed to the repository, the ascription system through <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> is ready for use. The only expected regular modifications to the configuration file are those of adding new translators. On the other hand, translators should never be removed, because even after they go away, their ascription records remain in the system.</p>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title"><a name="sec-ascinit" id="sec-ascinit"></a>6.2.1.&nbsp;Initial Ascription</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The most common situation at the start of ascription workflow is that there already exists a considerable amount of translations, contributed by many different people over time. These existing translations should be ascribed as initial modifications -- but ascribed to whom? If it is not precisely known who translated what, the solution is to introduce a generic user in the configuration file, appropriately named "Unknown Hero" (or "Lost Translator", you can be inventive):</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
[user-uhero]
name = Unknown Hero
original-name = Незнани јунак
</pre>
<p>You should then ascribe all existing translations as modified and reviewed by this dummy translator:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ cd $LANGDIR
$ poascribe commit -u uhero --all-reviewed -C  po/
</pre>
<p>The <code class="literal">commit</code> argument is the ascription mode, and the <code class="option">-u</code> option provides the user name to which ascriptions are made. This is an important point: ascriptions are made to a user defined in ascription configuration, and have nothing to do with VCS itself. It is the <code class="option">--all-reviewed</code> option that declares all messages to be reviewed as well (this option is normally used only this once, and not in day to day operation). The <code class="option">-C</code> option prevents automatic VCS adding and committing, which is useful for this initial step.</p>
<p>When this command line is executed, a progress bar will appear and the following output will start to unfold:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
doc/alpha.po  (43/43)
doc/bravo.po  (81/81)
...
ui/alpha.po  (582/582)
ui/bravo.po  (931/931)
...

<p>The number in parenthesis indicates how many messages have been ascribed in the given PO file (modified/reviewed), and at the end the totals are given.</p>
<p>If, on the contrary, it is known who translated and reviewed what up to that point, ascription can be performed piece-wise with user names of real translators:</p>

$ poascribe commit -u bob --all-reviewed -C  po/doc/

</pre>
<p><a name="p-ascftree" id="p-ascftree"></a>After the initial ascription has been made, the <span class="emphasis"><em>ascription file tree</em></span> will appear next to the original file tree. There will be one ascription PO file for each summit PO file, with the same name and relative location within the tree:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">

</pre>
<p>Ascription PO files are used by <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> to store the ascription history, rather than e.g. a database of some sort. This has the disadvantage in performance, but advantage in simplicity and robustness. For example, ascription files will be under version control as well.</p>
<p><span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> may also modify original PO files during this run, by removing any previous field comments (<code class="literal">#| ...</code>) on translated messages. These comments are sometimes erroneously left in when the PO file is translated with an older or less capable PO editor, and leaving them would result in unnecessary additions to ascription PO files.</p>
<p>The newly created ascription tree, any modifications to the original tree, and the ascription configuration file, can now be committed as usual. With Subversion as the VCS:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ cd $LANGDIR
$ svn add ascription-config po-ascript
$ svn commit ascription-config po po-ascript -m "Initial ascription."

</div>
<p>While this is generally a good idea, with ascription in place translators must always update the complete language directory by VCS, rather than just one particular PO file or subdirectory, so that the original and the ascription PO file trees are kept in sync.<sup>[<a name="id415538" href="#ftn.id415538" class="footnote" id="id415538">25</a>]</sup></p>
<p>In order not to have to report their user name to <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> all the time (by the <code class="option">-u</code> option), translators can set it in <a class="link" href="ch-common.html#sec-cmconfig" title="9.2.&nbsp;User Configuration">Pology user configuration</a>, the <code class="literal">[poascribe]</code> section:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
[poascribe]
user = alice
</pre>
<p>With this in place, translators can submit updated PO files simply by substituting VCS commit command with <code class="literal">poascribe commit</code> (or shortened: <code class="literal">co</code> or <code class="literal">ci</code>). With Subversion, this would look like:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ cd $LANGDIR
$ poascribe co po/ui/*alpha*.po

<p>As can be seen from the example output, <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> will add ascription records into ascription PO files corresponding to original PO files, and commit them all. Like a VCS command, <span class="command"><strong>poascribe co</strong></span> can take any number of PO file or directory paths. For a directory path, only files with <code class="filename">.po</code> extension in it will be processed, and any other ignored. <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> can be run from any working directory with appropriate paths as arguments, and it will always find the associated ascription configuration and files.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>With the ascription system in place, every regular translator should have the commit access to the repository. But, there may be some period of time before new translators are given commit access, or revision control may be too technical for some, and even those who have access may not be able to commit temporarily for some reason.</p>
<p>These translators may send in their work by email or any other informal channel, to <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> member of the team how does have commit access. This team member can then commit received files without any review, as review can be conducted at any later time. If Bob sends some files to Alice, she can commit them immediately by stating Bob's user name:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe co -u bob <em class="replaceable"><code>files...</code></em>
</pre>
<p>For this to work, the translator who sent in the files has to be defined in the ascription configuration. There are no hidden costs or security issues to this (as opposed to giving VCS commit access), so every new translator should be defined there before any work of that person is committed.</p>

<p>An ascription system opens up all sorts of possibilities for review patterns. Reviewers should keep in mind that for each message the full modification and review history is available, so that the translation team can think about how to make good use of it.

<p>At the very basic level (which is the only level in <a class="link" href="ch-ascript.html#sec-ascrevcomp" title="6.1.&nbsp;Review Stages vs. Ascription">review by stages</a>), messages can be classified as simply unreviewed or reviewed. Alice now wants to review all unreviewed messages in a subset of PO files, say the <code class="filename">ui/</code> subdirectory. She issues the following command (<code class="literal">di</code> is short for <code class="literal">diff</code>):</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe di po/ui/
po/ui/alpha.po  (2)
po/ui/foxtrot.po  (7)
po/ui/november.po  (12)
===== Diffed for review: 21
$
</pre>
<p>With this, all unreviewed messages in listed PO files have been marked, and <span class="emphasis"><em>diffed</em></span>. If these PO files had already been reviewed before, some of the messages modified since then (those now marked for review) may have changed very little. For example, a few changed words in a paragraph-length message, or even just some punctuation. Therefore, for each message marked for review, Alice also wants to see the difference since the last review to current version. Here are two messages with typical review elements added by <code class="literal">poascribe di</code>:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
#. ~ascto: charlie:m
#: gui/mainwindow.cc:372
#, ediff
msgid "GAME OVER. {-You won-}{+Tie+}!"
msgstr "KRAJ IGRE. {-Pobeda-}{+Nerešeno+}!"

#. ~ascto: bob:m charlie:m
#: game-state.cpp:117
#, ediff-total
msgid "Click the pause button again to resume the game."
msgstr "Kliknite ponovo na dugme pauze da nastavite igru."
</pre>
<p>In the first message, the first thing to note is the <code class="literal">#. ~ascto:</code> comment. This comment succinctly lists who did what with the message since the last review; here <code class="literal">charlie:m</code> means that Charlie is the one who modified it. Then there is the <code class="literal">ediff</code> flag, which Alice can search for in the editor to jump through messages marked for review. Finally, the original and translation have been diffed; here they show that, since the last review, the message was fuzzied by changing "You won" to "Tie", and what Charlie did in translation to unfuzzy it. Even on a message as short as this, the difference tells something useful to Alice: the phrase "Game over" likely has a formulaic translation, and the fact that it is not part of the difference means that the earlier reviewer had made sure it is consistent, so Alice does not have to check that.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">#. ~ascto:</code> comment of the second message reveals that both Charlie and Bob had been modifying it. The <code class="literal">ediff-total</code> flag instead of plain <code class="literal">ediff</code> means that this message had no reviews until now, so there are no embedded differences in text fields.</p>
<p>Alice can now go through marked messages in listed PO files, review translations, and possibly make modifications. When making changes in a message with embedded differences, she can freely edit the text outside of difference segments and within <code class="literal">{+...+}</code> segments (as these are the ones which belong to current version of the text). While reviewing, Alice does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> remove any of the added message elements (except for an occasional difference segment, if she modifies a translation), as these elements are needed for a subsequent invocation of <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span>. If a message is particularly hard to translate and Alice wants to defer reviewing it for some later time, she can add to it the <code class="literal">unreviewed</code> flag (or <code class="literal">nrev</code> for short).</p>
<p>Once the review is complete, Alice simply commits the reviewed files:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe co po/ui/
po/ui/alpha.po  (0/2)
po/ui/foxtrot.po  (0/7)
po/ui/november.po  (3/12)

Committed revision 1284220.
$
</pre>
<p>Three things have happened here. First, all review states (flags, embedded differences, etc.) have been removed, restoring diffed PO files to original state. Then, any modifications that Alice has made during review are ascribed to her (here 3 out of 21 messages). Finally, all marked messages are ascribed as reviewed by Alice (any with <code class="literal">unreviewed</code> or <code class="literal">nrev</code> flags would have been omitted here). When committing, the only original PO file that got committed is the one with modifications made during review, and all the ascription PO files were committed because of the reviews recorded in them.</p>
<p>When many PO files with few changes per file should be reviewed, it becomes burdensome to manually open each and every diffed file for review, and then to make sure that all are committed with <span class="command"><strong>poascribe co</strong></span>. To make this easier, <code class="literal">-w toreview.out</code> option can be added to the <code class="literal">poascribe di</code> command line, which requests that paths of all diffed PO files be written into <code class="filename">toreview.out</code> file. This file can then be used to batch-open diffed PO files in an editor, as well as to commit them later by adding <code class="literal">-f toreview.out</code> to <code class="literal">poascribe co</code>. There is also <code class="option">-o</code> option, which tells <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> to directly open PO files in one of the supported PO editors (see <a class="xref" href="ch-common.html#sec-cmsupped" title="9.7.1.&nbsp;PO Editors">Section&nbsp;9.7.1, “PO Editors”</a>). Putting it together, to efficiently review a whole bunch of small changes throughout many PO files, with Lokalize as the PO editor, you can execute:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe di <em class="replaceable"><code>paths...</code></em> -w toreview.out -o lokalize
$ # ...only marked messages opened in Lokalize, review them...
$ poascribe co -f toreview.out
</pre>
<p>If for whatever reason you want to simply remove the review elements from messages without committing the PO files (effectively discarding the review), you can use the <code class="literal">purge</code> mode (short <code class="literal">pu</code>) of <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span>:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe pu <em class="replaceable"><code>paths...</code></em>
</pre>
<p>If <code class="option">-k</code>/<code class="option">--keep-flags</code> option is added to this command line, the flags which mark the messages as reviewed get preserved; more precisely, every <code class="literal">ediff*</code> flag is replaced with <code class="literal">reviewed</code> flag, and every <code class="literal">unreviewed</code> flag is left in, so that subsequent invocation of <code class="literal">poascribe co</code> can record reviews. You will want this limited purging if you have some automatic validation tools to run before committing, and these tools would be thrown off by review elements (most likely by embedded differences).</p>

<h3 class="title"><a name="sec-ascselrev" id="sec-ascselrev"></a>6.4.2.&nbsp;Selecting Messages for Review</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Invocations of <span class="command"><strong>poascribe di</strong></span> without any options, as in the previous section, are equivalent to this:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe di -s modar <em class="replaceable"><code>paths...</code></em>
</pre>
<p>The <code class="option">-s</code> option serves to issue a message <span class="emphasis"><em>selector</em></span>. <code class="literal">modar</code> is the default selector for the <code class="literal">diff</code> operation mode, and stands for "MODified-After-Review": it selects the earliest historical modification of the message after the last (or no) review of that message, if there is any such. By selecting a historical modification of the message, the difference from it to current version can be computed and embedded into the PO file, as seen in earlier examples.</p>
<p><a name="p-seltypes" id="p-seltypes"></a>There are various specialized selectors, and they fall into two groups: <span class="emphasis"><em>shallow selectors</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>history selectors</em></span>. Shallow selectors look only into the current version of the message, and cannot select historical versions, which means that they cannot provide embedded differences. History selectors (<code class="literal">modar</code> is of this type) can select messages from history and provide differences. Several selectors can be issued on the command line, and the message is selected only if all selectors select it (boolean AND-linking). Shallow selectors are thus normally used as a pre-filters for history selectors. For example, to select messages modified after the last review, but only those <a class="link" href="ch-summit.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Summitting Translation Branches">found in the stable branch</a>, <code class="literal">branch</code> and <code class="literal">modar</code> selectors are chained like this:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe di -s branch:stable -s modar <em class="replaceable"><code>paths...</code></em>
</pre>
<p>It is important that the history selector is given last, because the last selector determines which historical message is selected for diffing. If the ordering had been reversed in this example, same messages would get selected, but they would not have embedded differences, because <code class="literal">branch</code> is a shallow selector.</p>
<p>Selectors can take parameters themselves, like <code class="literal">branch:stable</code> in the previous example. Parameters are separated from the selector name by any non-alphanumeric character; this is colon by convention, but if a parameter contains a colon, something else, like slash, tilde, etc. can be used. Number of parameters can vary, and <code class="literal">modar</code> in particular can take from none to three. If Alice wants to review only those messages modified <span class="emphasis"><em>by Charlie</em></span> since the last review, she states this by first argument to <code class="literal">modar</code>:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe di -s modar:charlie <em class="replaceable"><code>paths...</code></em>
</pre>
<p>If Alice does not give much credit to other reviewers, she can request selection of messages modified after <span class="emphasis"><em>her own</em></span> last review with second parameter to <code class="literal">modar</code>:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe di -s modar::alice <em class="replaceable"><code>paths...</code></em>
</pre>
<p>Here the first parameter ("modified by..."), which is not needed, must be explicitly skipped, before proceeding to the second parameter ("reviewed by..."). (The third optional parameter to <code class="literal">modar</code> will be demonstrated later on.)</p>
<p>When a selector parameter is a user name, normally it can also be a comma-separated list of user names (<code class="literal">modar:bob,charlie</code>) or prefixed with tilde to negate, i.e. to select all users other than those listed (<code class="literal">modar:~alice</code>).</p>
<p>Any selector can be negated by prepending <code class="literal">n</code> to its name. For example, the history selector <code class="literal">modafter:<em class="replaceable"><code>date</code></em></code> selects first modification after the given date; to select messages modified after the last review, but only if modified during June 2010:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe di -s modafter:2010-06 -s nmodafter:2010-07 -s modar <em class="replaceable"><code>paths...</code></em>
</pre>
<p>Negating a history selector produces a shallow selector: while <code class="literal">modafter</code> is a history selector, <code class="literal">nmodafter</code> is shallow. But the mutual ordering of the two in this example is not important, since the last selector in the chain is the usual <code class="literal">modar</code>.</p>
<p>Selectors can be issued in other modes too. If the PO file is big, and Alice has reviewed messages up to and including the message with entry number 246 when she has to pause until another day, she can commit reviews only up to this entry by issuing the <code class="literal">espan</code> selector:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe co -s espan::246 <em class="replaceable"><code>paths...</code></em>
</pre>
<p>The first parameter to <code class="literal">espan</code>, here omitted, would be the entry number of the first message to select, in case messages should not be selected starting from the first in the file. There is also the counterpart <code class="literal">lspan</code> selector, which works with referent line numbers (those of <code class="varname">msgid</code> keywords) instead of entry numbers.</p>
<p>If you do not want to immediately diff for review, but to see first how many messages would be selected by the selector chain that you assembled, you can use the <code class="literal">status</code> operation mode (<code class="literal">st</code> for short) instead of <code class="literal">diff</code>. It takes selectors in the same way as <code class="literal">diff</code>, and shows counts of selected messages by category. You can also add the <code class="option">-b</code> option to have counts reported by PO file (where non-zero).</p>
<p>You may also want to observe the complete recorded ascription history of a message, all its modifications and reviews, with differences between each two modifications. For this you can use the <code class="literal">history</code> operation mode (<code class="literal">hi</code> for short), typically with one of <code class="literal">l</code> or <code class="literal">e</code> selectors to single out a particular message. The history will be written out to terminal, starting from the newest to the oldest version of the message, with highlighted embedded differences.</p>

<h3 class="title"><a name="sec-ascfgrev" id="sec-ascfgrev"></a>6.4.3.&nbsp;Fine-Grained Reviews</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the introduction of this chapter, several distinct things that can go wrong in translation were described. Not all reviewers may be able to check translation against all those problems. Here is a typical scenario of this kind:</p>
<p>Alice is computer-savvy and knows the translation project inside and out, which means that she can review well for context, terminology, and technical style. But, her language style leaves something to be desired, which shows in longer sentences and passages. Dan, on the other hand, is a very literary person, but not that much into the technical aspects. Dan's style reviews would thus be a perfect complement to Alice's general reviews.</p>
<p><span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> can support this scenario in the following way. A <span class="emphasis"><em>review type</em></span> tag <code class="literal">lstyle</code> for language style is defined in the ascription configuration, using the <code class="literal">review-tags</code> field:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
[global]
...
review-tags = lstyle
</pre>
<p>With this addition to configuration, Alice can continue to review as she did before, without any changes in her workflow.</p>
<p>Dan selects messages for review similarly to Alice, but additionally giving the <code class="literal">lstyle</code> tag as the <span class="emphasis"><em>third</em></span> parameter of <code class="literal">modar</code>, and indicating that reviews should be tagged as <code class="literal">lstyle</code> using the <code class="option">-t</code> option:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe di -s modar:::lstyle -t lstyle <em class="replaceable"><code>paths...</code></em>
</pre>
<p>After finishing the review, Dan commits as usual:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe co PATHS...
</pre>
<p>If Dan is always going to review the language style, in order not to have to issue the selector and the tag in command line all the time, he can make them default for the <code class="literal">diff</code> mode in Pology user configuration:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
[poascribe]
user = dan
selectors/diff = modar:::lstyle
tags/diff = lstyle
</pre>
<p>With this, Dan can use plain <code class="literal">poascribe di</code> just like Alice does.</p>
<p>The important point of review tags is that they make reviews by types independent. For example, Dan may come around to review the language style of the given message after several modifications and general reviews have been ascribed to it -- <code class="literal">modar:::lstyle</code> will simply ignore all reviews other than <code class="literal">lstyle</code> reviews. This is going to be reflected in the <code class="literal">~ascto:</code> comment of diffed messages:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
#...
#. ~ascto: charlie:m alice:r bob:m
#...
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."
</pre>
<p>Here Alice has made one review between Charlie's and Bob's modifications, and that review, being general instead of <code class="literal">lstyle</code>, did not cause <code class="literal">modar</code> to stop at it. After Dan reviews this message for language style, Alice runs selection for review and gets this:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
#...
#. ascto: bob:m dan:r(lstyle)
#...
msgid "..."
msgstr "..."
</pre>
<p>Again, since <code class="literal">lstyle</code> reviews do not mix with general reviews<sup>[<a name="id463063" href="#ftn.id463063" class="footnote" id="id463063">27</a>]</sup>, Dan's review did not hide Bob's modification that Alice did not check so far.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>After the ascription system is set up, there should be very little to do to maintain it. The details depend on the established translation workflow, and this section describes some of the procedures which may apply.</p>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title"><a name="sec-ascmerge" id="sec-ascmerge"></a>6.5.1.&nbsp;Ascribing Merges</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>If PO files are periodically merged with templates in a centralized manner, by one designated person or repository automation, these modifications must also be ascribed. This is done as any other ascription, by substituting the VCS commit command with <code class="literal">poascribe co</code>. For example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ svn commit $LANGDIR -m "Everything merged."
</pre>
<p>may be substituted with:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
$ poascribe commit $LANGDIR -m "Everything merged."
</pre>
<p>Since the user is not explicitly given by the <code class="option">-u</code> option, this will ascribe modifications due to merging to the person set in Pology user configuration on the system where the command is executed. This is just fine. It is also possible to define a dummy user to which modifications due to merging are ascribed, though there is no known advantage to that at present.</p>
<p>Note that you can issue the <code class="option">-C</code> option to prevent <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> from automatically committing merged files, in case are some automatic post-merge operations that you would like to perform on merged PO files beforehand. Afterward, standalone VCS commit command can be issued, but do not forget to include the ascription file tree in it as well.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title"><a name="sec-ascshuffle" id="sec-ascshuffle"></a>6.5.2.&nbsp;Shuffling Ascription PO Files</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sometimes PO files are "shuffled" in the repository: renamed, moved to another subdirectory, etc. Such shuffling should be exactly mirrored in the ascription tree:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>If a PO file is moved or renamed, its counterpart ascription PO file should also be moved or renamed in the same way within the ascription tree.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>If a PO file is split into two, then it depends on how you handle the splitting. A good way would be to copy the old PO file to two new names, and then merge them with new templates. In this way as much of existing translation as possible will be preserved. If this is done, then the ascription PO files should be copied to new names, but then there is nothing to merge them with. This is just right, since message ascription histories generally interleave across the split (but also see <a class="xref" href="ch-ascript.html#sec-asctrim" title="6.5.4.&nbsp;Trimming Ascription History">Section&nbsp;6.5.4, “Trimming Ascription History”</a>).</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>If two PO files are merged into one, you should probably handle that by using <span class="command"><strong>msgcat</strong></span> to properly concatenate them into the new PO file, and then merge the new PO file with its template. Then, the old ascription PO files should be concatenated with <span class="command"><strong>msgcat</strong></span> as well, and nothing more. But, <span class="emphasis"><em>make sure</em></span> that you issue the <code class="option">--use-first</code> to <span class="command"><strong>msgcat</strong></span>, for both concatenations. This is because when in the two concatenated PO files there are two messages with same <code class="varname">msgctxt</code>+<code class="varname">msgid</code> but different <code class="varname">msgstr</code>, <span class="command"><strong>msgcat</strong></span> will by default make a free-form composition of <code class="varname">msgstr</code> texts, for translator to manually disentangle later. This would ruin the ascription entry of such a message in the concatenated ascription PO file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>After the shuffling is performed in both file trees, <code class="literal">poascribe co</code> is executed to smooth out and commit modifications.</p>

<p>By default, a historical message is selected for diffing with current message based on the last history selector given by <code class="option">-s</code>/<code class="option">--selector</code> option (if any). Instead, with this option you can explicitly set the selector for historical messages. It will be applied after the message has been selected by the primary selector chain.

<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-A <em class="replaceable"><code>RATIO</code></em></code>, <code class="option">--min-adjsim-diff=<em class="replaceable"><code>RATIO</code></em></code></span></dt>

If the difference is not shown due to this limit, the message will get the flag <code class="literal">ediff-ignored</code> instead of the usual <code class="literal">ediff</code>.

</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-C</code>, <code class="option">--no-vcs-commit</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Issue this option if you want <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> not to commit modifications to version control itself. This may be useful if you want to examine raw modifications it made, to perform some checks, etc, and commit manually later. But <span class="emphasis"><em>do not</em></span> modify any messages in between, as that would defeat the purpose of ascription.</p>

<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-d <em class="replaceable"><code>LEVEL</code></em></code>, <code class="option">--depth=<em class="replaceable"><code>LEVEL</code></em></code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Operation modes normally consider ascription history of a message starting from the newest and going down to the earliest ascription. With this option you can set the depth to which history is examined, where 0 is the newest ascription only, 1 the current and first previous ascription, etc.</p>

<p>Some special (possibly custom) selectors may need to examine only differences or commonalities between each two adjacent messages. In order not to have to build this functionality into each such selector, you can issue this option to preprocess ascription history such that each historical message is reduced based on the difference with the next earlier message. The message can be reduced to the parts equal, added or removed as compared to the earlier message. This is controlled by the <code class="literal"><em class="replaceable"><code>SPEC</code></em></code> value, which must start with one of the letters <code class="literal">e</code> (equal), <code class="literal">a</code> (added), or <code class="literal">r</code> (removed). This letter may be followed with an arbitrary sequence of characters, which will be used to separate the remaining parts of the text in the message; if there are no additional characters, space is used as the separator.</p>

<dd>
<p>Sometimes it may be necessary to apply selectors not to the ascription history as it is, but to a suitably filtered version of the history. This option can be used to set a Pology F1A hook as filter, see <a class="xref" href="ch-common.html#sec-cmhooks" title="9.10.&nbsp;Processing Hooks">Section&nbsp;9.10, “Processing Hooks”</a> for details. It can be repeated to set several filters.</p>

<dd>
<p>When setting a filter on ascription history by the <code class="option">-F</code>/<code class="option">--filter</code> option in the <code class="literal">diff</code> mode, it may be good to see also the difference in filtered messages, those on which the selectors were actually applied. By issuing this option, every message field with an embedded difference will get added a visually conspicuous separator, followed by the filtered version of the text with difference as well. When you commit or purge the PO file diffed in this way, the separators and the filtered text are removed together with all other review elements.</p>

<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-k</code>, <code class="option">--keep-flags</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>When the diffed PO file is purged of review elements, by default all review elements are removed, so that on subsequent commit only modifications would be ascribed, if there were any. Issuing this option on purge causes that all review elements except for flags are removed. More precisely, <code class="literal">ediff*</code> flags are replaced with <code class="literal">reviewed</code>, and <code class="literal">unreviewed</code> flags are simply kept. This makes the subsequent commit also ascribe reviews. You need this if you want to apply some automatic checks to the PO file after the review and before the commit, where more intrusive review elements (like embedded differences) would interfere.</p>

<p>When diffing for review, instead of manually opening diffed PO files and searching for messages by flags, this option can be issued to have <span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> automatically open PO files in a PO editor (and possibly have the editor filter the message list to only selected messages). This work only with PO editors explicitly supported by Pology; the <em class="replaceable"><code>EDITOR</code></em> value is an editor keyword rather than an arbitrary editor command. See <a class="xref" href="ch-common.html#sec-cmsupped" title="9.7.1.&nbsp;PO Editors">Section&nbsp;9.7.1, “PO Editors”</a> for the list of supported editors.</p>

<p>In <code class="literal">diff</code> mode, this option sets the ratio of selected messages to total messages in a given PO file, above which no message in that file will be selected although the selector chain matched them. The value is the number between 0.0 and 1.0; for example, 0.2 means to accept selection if the number of selected messages is at most 20% of the total number of messages. This can be used to discern between reviewing updated PO files and newly translated PO files, as the latter take much more time to review and hence may be of lesser priority.</p>

<p>The review tag, denoting the type of the review. If <code class="literal">review-tags</code> field in ascription configuration set, this must be one of the tags defined there (general review has an empty string as tag, which is the default). The tag is normally issued in <code class="literal">diff</code> mode: it will be appended to review flags on diffed messages (e.g. <code class="literal">ediff/<em class="replaceable"><code>tag</code></em></code>), which will cause on commit that the review of this type is ascribed. In <code class="literal">commit</code> mode, this option has effect only if <code class="option">--all-reviewed</code> is issued as well, in which case this tag will override any from the PO file. Several tags may be given as comma-separated list.</p>

<p><span class="command"><strong>poascribe</strong></span> provides a variety of internal selectors, and new selectors are added as general need for them is observed in practice. Selectors come in two types: history and shallow; the former also select a historical message from which to show the differences to the current message, while the latter do not. Arguments to selectors are added consistently separated with any non-alphanumeric character, customarily colon (<code class="literal">:</code>) when possible. If less arguments are given than the selector can take, all remaining arguments are set to empty (the selector may or may not accept this).</p>
<p>Available internal selectors are as follows:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
