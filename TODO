* Build system.

  Distutils take too Python-centric view,
  while Pology contains a lot of non-Python data.
  In the future, it may also contain C/C++ modules,
  or even end-user executables.
  A general-purpose build system is needed.
  CMake?


* Web site.

  Minimal, informative web site, at pology.nedohodnik.net
  (currently there is only documentation there).
  All manually modified files should reside in www/,
  and the web site should be updateable with www/updatewww.sh.

  How to handle new release tarballs?


* Translation of the user manual.

  All current Docbook-PO extractor-injectors are unacceptable,
  because some combination of:
  - they do not provide sufficient structural information for context
  - they pull out too much structural information from messages
  - they produce ill-formed XML on the single message level
  - they introduce non-Docbook tags as placeholders
  Therefore first a new Docbook-PO extractor-injector is needed.

  A possible goal could also be to extract Docbook so completely
  that the original Docbook is not necessary on injection.
  I.e. there is actually no injection as such, but the translated
  Docbook can be reconstructed from the PO file alone.


* Man-pages.

  Probably by updating and factoring out sections of the user manual
  which currently list command line options of scripts,
  so that they can be used in both the user manual
  and in standalone man-page producing Docbooks.


* Unit tests.

  First priority are modules catalog, message, and header,
  and everything they use from other modules.
  Then comes the rest of the library based on how flaky it is.
  Scripts the least priority.

  Custom tests, or using some framework?


* Update scripts to Pology conventions (i18n, ColorOptionParser...).

  - scripts/normalize-aspell-word-list.py
  - lang/sr/scripts/traplint.py


* Convert all errors in scripts to exceptions, rely on exit_on_exception().

  Make it possible to disable hiding the backtrace in exit_on_exception(),
  through user configuration and environment variable.
