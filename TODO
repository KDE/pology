* Build system.

  Distutils take too Python-centric view,
  while Pology contains a lot of non-Python data.
  In the future, it may also contain C/C++ modules,
  or even end-user executables.
  A general-purpose build system is needed.
  CMake?


* Translation of the user manual.

  All current Docbook-PO extractor-injectors are unacceptable,
  because some combination of:
  - they do not provide sufficient structural information for context
  - they pull out too much structural information from messages
  - they produce ill-formed XML on the single message level
  - they introduce non-Docbook tags as placeholders
  Therefore first a new Docbook-PO extractor-injector is needed.

  A possible goal could also be to extract Docbook so completely
  that the original Docbook is not necessary on injection.
  I.e. there is actually no injection as such, but the translated
  Docbook can be reconstructed from the PO file alone.
